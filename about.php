<h2>Loose TEA Music Theatre - An Overview</h2>
<p>Loose TEA Music Theatre was founded in 2013 by our Artistic Director Alaina Viau and was officially incorporated as a Federal Not For Profit Corporation in February 2014. We are located in Toronto, Canada, and we specialize in Opera and Orchestra performances. Loose TEA's mission is to take classical musical and operatic works and entrench them with the issues, concerns and topics of our present day world. Loose TEA Music Theatre challenges, motivates, and inspires our audience through the medium of music and opera, in a way that is approachable, understandable and relevant. Loose TEA is an opera company for the 21st century that is followed by a new generation of opera goers.
<p>The inaugural production in August 2013 was a re-working of the famous Carmen by Bizet. In this version, the story was reduced from 3 hours to 1 while rearranging the story to correspond to the original novella plot. It was set in 1920's New York where Carmen is a burlesque dancer and Don Jose is a PTSD suffering WW1 veteran. 
<p>Our 2nd production in August 2014 was entitled "Love in the Age of Autocorrect" featuring a double dill of Mozart's Bastien und Bastienne (renamed Andrew and Andrea) and Stravinsky's Mavra. Both comedies were translated into modern English and set in current times to comment on how the digital world affects our interpersonal relationship. 
<p>At Loose TEA we are also cognizant of the many alternative activities that are available today to a young urban audience. With this in mind we are creating a social event, not just an opera going experience. This social event is to be held at a convenient, comfortable location and have a casual non-pretentious atmosphere. Our opera will be performed at locations that are trusted by our younger audience and will be affordable to them. We plan on having our operas be an activity where people can start their night out, be with friends, have a drink, and enjoy some amazing music. 
<p>Our productions and our unique theatre going experience, we believe, have helped and will continue to help make opera relevant, meaningful and accessible to this younger audience. It is the goal of Loose TEA to establish a lifelong link between the classics and a younger, urban, hip, engaged audience.
